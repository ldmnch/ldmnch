## Hi there! 

I'm Laia (she/her). I'm a Sociologist who pivoted to Data Science and happily found the intersection of these two things doing Data Science for Public Policy. I enjoy exploring creative ways to generate, analyze, and repurpose data to better understand and address social challenges. I have experience in different projects in academia, NGO and teaching, you can look into them in detail at my [website](https://ldmnch.github.io/layitx/about.html).
